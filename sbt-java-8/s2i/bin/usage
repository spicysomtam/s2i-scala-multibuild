This is the s2i-scala-multibuild S2I image:
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Need to include some env vars to tell the builder what to do:
SBT_BUILDS="dir1/targets dir2/targets" # cd to each dir, run sbt with the target/s. Last build is the app installed in the output image and its target should be stage.
DEBUG="something" # Turn on debug for the assemble/build script so you can see what it is doing.
Include a volume for the builder, and this will be mounted under /opt/build in the build container.

Sample invocation (you can use https://<url> instead of . ):

$ mkdir /var/tmp/s2i
$ cd <source>
$ s2i build -v /var/tmp/s2i:/opt/build --env SBT_BUILDS="dir1/clean dir2/publishLocal dir3/stage" \
 --env DEBUG=something . spicysomtam/s2i-scala-multibuild:latest <app-image>

You can then test run the resulting image via:
$ docker run -d <app-image>
